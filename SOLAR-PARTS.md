## Compute
- Raspberry Pi

      I use a Pi4, but anything 3b and above should be fine. Needs to have Wifi
      Any make should be fine. I use Element14.

- SD Card

      Not a lot of storage requirement here. I usually wind up with a 32GB from Sandisk.

- ADS-B receiver

      I've tried a couple. They all work about the same. Just look for one for ADS-B.

- Feedline

      Need to connect the receiver to the antenna -- usually male SMA to male N
      I got a kit with the feedline, antenna, and mount included.

- Antenna

      An antenna for ADS-B or 1090 MHz. Don't think too long at all. Just buy the one you like.
      You will see very little difference in receive between antennas.
